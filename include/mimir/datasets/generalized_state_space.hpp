/// @brief `GeneralizedStateSpace` is an additional graph build on top of `StateSpaceList` to represent the state transition model of a class of problems.
///
/// The central features of this implementation are:
/// - the direct applicability of a large collection of Boost BGL graph algorithms on these graphs, making it convenient to analyze state transition models.
/// - the option to apply symmetry reduction (using graph isomorphism).
///
/// The `graphs::ClassGraph` acts as the main interface to retrieve information about the state transition model of a class of problems.
/// Each vertex in the `graphs::ClassGraph` has a single representative from a `graphs::ProblemGraph`.
/// When symmetry reduction is disabled, there is a strict one-to-one mapping between `graphs::ClassVertex` and `graphs::ProblemVertex`
/// and a strict one-to-one mapping between `graphs::ClassEdge` and `graphs::ProblemEdge`.
/// When symmetry reduction is enabled, the mapping may become a strict one-to-many mapping, in which case, the `graphs::ClassVertex`
/// or `graphs::ClassEdge` acts as an interface to access the representative.
///
/// The `GeneralizedStateSpace` provides several convenience functions to map between `graphs::ClassVertex` (resp. `graphs::ClassEdge`) and
/// `graphs::ProblemVertex` (resp. `graphs::ProblemEdge`).
