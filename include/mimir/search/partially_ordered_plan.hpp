/// @brief `PartiallyOrderedPlan` (POP) represents a total-order plan (TOP) augmented with a strict partial order `<`, where `a_i < a_j` indicates that
/// action `a_i` must strictly precede action `a_j` in any valid execution order. The relation `<` is irreflexive.
///
/// More precisely, `<(a_i, a_j)` holds if `a_i` adds a precondition of `a_j`, or if `a_i` deletes a precondition of `a_j`. This causal relation is defined
/// independently of whether any conditional effects are actually triggered in preceding states.
///
/// Notes: the current implementation only supports fluent ground atoms and throws an exception for plans that use derived atoms or numeric constraints.
